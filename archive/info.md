As Chief Data Scientist I built and led a newly-formed team focused on developing production-scale solutions to identify and capture $100M+ margin enhancing opportunities in the areas of pricing, offers and other appropriate sales and marketing instruments. We used methods of modern day artificial intelligence – e.g., machine learning, Bayesian simulation (MCMC), in-memory/distributed computing (Spark; Hadoop) – to overcome the limitations of quantitative approaches traditionally employed in pricing and marketing. As leader of this group I was charged with not only working with Sears' senior executive team (including CEO) to communicate our vision and strategy, but also identifying, recruiting, and retaining the data science talent critical to supporting this major initiative.

On the Factorial Structure of the SAT and Implications for Next-Generation College Readiness Assessments
Educational and Psychological MeasurementOctober 1, 2014
The name “SAT” has become synonymous with college admissions testing; it has been dubbed “the gold standard.” Numerous studies on its reliability and predictive validity show that the SAT predicts college performance beyond high school grade point average. Surprisingly, studies of the factorial structure of the current version of today’s SAT, revised in 2005, have not been reported, if conducted. One purpose of this study was to examine the factorial structure of two administrations of the SAT (October 2010 and May 2011), testing competing models (e.g., one-factor—general ability; two factor—mathematics and “literacy”; three factor—mathematics, critical reading, and writing). We found support for the two-factor model with revise-in-context writing items loading on (and bridging) a reading and writing factor equally, thereby bridging these factors into a literacy factor. A second purpose was to draw tentative implications of our finding for the “next generation” SAT or other college readiness exams in light of Common Core State Standards Consortia efforts, suggesting that combining critical reading and writing (including the essay) would offer unique revision opportunities. More specifically, a reading and writing (combined) construct might pose a relevant problem or issue with multiple documents to be used to answer questions about the issue(s) (multiple-choice, short answer) and to write an argumentative/analytical essay based on the documents provided. In this way, there may not only be an opportunity to measure students’ literacy but also perhaps students’ critical thinking—key factors in assessing college readiness.

Alternative investment strategic initiatives with North American and European institutional investors
2001 – 2004
Built extensive knowledge base in alternative investment strategies through deep research and quantitative analyses of risk/return and capital ows models associated with alternative investment asset classes (including private equity, hedge funds, venture capital, and natural resources investment instruments). Conducted extensive quantitative analyses to model portfolio risk/return and capital flows impacts of investments in various classes of hedge funds. Served as McKinsey expert in absolute return investment classes as well as methods for modeling portfolio risk/return implications across alternative asset allocation scenarios.

Completed comprehensive quantitative analysis of venture capital industry performance to project near- and mid-term industry performance and structure. Identified drivers of industry-wide levels of VC investments and returns, as well as drivers of distinctive performance within the VC sector. Specified industry-level implications under alternative scenarios of VC sector evolution. Developed perspective on implications for VC firms with respect to investment strategy and organization. Work subsequently cited widely within private equity and venture capital industry circles.

Alternative investments consulting for a leading university endowment
2001 – 2002
Developed natural resources investment strategy to capture asset class opportunities for excess return and diversification. Worked with CEO and CIO to define organizational goals and risk/return objectives for natural resources asset class. Benchmarked peer endowments' approaches to natural resources investment. Developed perspective on client's advantage as a preferred investor in category. Modeled correlations and capital flows, as well as potential impact on endowment risk/return profile, of candidate classes of investment vehicles (including absolute return and hedge funds; buyout/venture private equity; resource ownership funds; natural resource equity indices and mutual funds; actively managed futures; and commodities). Conducted extensive interviews with best-in-class managers. Developed strategic plan with target allocation ranges across investment vehicles, associated capital flows model, and profiles of target managers within each investment vehicle. Developed specific recommendations with respect to a poorly-perforsources portfolio to better capture opportunities in high potential investment vehicles as well as to capitalize on diversification of natural resources investments against portfolio equity exposure.
