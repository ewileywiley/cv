                      As the leader of Seagate's Big Data Analytics initiative, I built and
                      led a team of highly trained data scientists, engineers, and
                      researchers to push the envelope of Big Data Analytics (e.g., machine learning;
                      deep learning), primarily related to next-generation Cloud technologies
                      (Hadoop; Spark). In this role I served as strategist, subject matter expert
                      and external spokesperson for this newly-formed initiative within Seagate’s
                      Data Center Operations group.

            Activities and Societies: First student in my school to be awarded the 3-year Stanford President's Full-Tuition Graduate Fellowship in Science and Engineering. Received "Outstanding" teaching ratings in eight basic and advanced statistics courses. One of three Stanford students named to Stanford Trustees' Committees on Research and Graduate Studies. Invited speaker for Inaugural Celebration of Stanford President's Graduate Fellowship in Science/Engineering
            Dissertation: Bootstrap Strategies for Variance Component Estimation: Analytical
            and Empirical Results. Dissertation Committee: Richard Shavelson, Edward Haertel,
            Bradley Efron, Kenji Hakuta, and Ewart Thomas. Dissertation study established
            new algorithms to estimate variance components and standard errors. Study
            mathematically demonstrated bias in bootstrap estimation of variance components,
            accuracy of which was demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulation.  Study solved problem
            that had puzzled researchers for over 13 years. Dissertation won both national award
            (NCME's Outstanding Dissertation Award), as well as $20,000 Stanford fellowship.
