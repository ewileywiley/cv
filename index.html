					<span>Chief Data Scientist; DVP, Pricing | Data Science & Artificial Intelligence</span> <span id="size">Chicago, IL</span> <span id="italic">2015-2016</span>
					<p>As Chief Data Scientist I built and led a newly-formed team focused on developing production-scale solutions to identify and capture $100M+ margin enhancing opportunities in the areas of pricing, offers and other appropriate sales and marketing instruments. We used methods of modern day artificial intelligence – e.g., machine learning, Bayesian simulation (MCMC), in-memory/distributed computing (Spark; Hadoop) – to overcome the limitations of quantitative approaches traditionally employed in pricing and marketing. As leader of this group I was charged with not only working with Sears' senior executive team (including CEO) to communicate our vision and strategy, but also identifying, recruiting, and retaining the data science talent critical to supporting this major initiative.</p>

Received "Outstanding" teaching ratings in eight basic and advanced statistics courses. One of three Stanford students named to Stanford Trustees' Committees on Research and Graduate Studies. Invited speaker for Inaugural Celebration of Stanford President's Graduate Fellowship in Science/Engineering Dissertation: Bootstrap Strategies for Variance Component Estimation: Analytical and Empirical Results. Dissertation Committee: Richard Shavelson, Edward Haertel, Bradley Efron, Kenji Hakuta, and Ewart Thomas. Dissertation study established new algorithms to estimate variance components and standard errors. Study mathematically demonstrated bias in bootstrap estimation of variance components, accuracy of which was demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulation. Study solved problem that had puzzled researchers for over 13 years. Dissertation won both national award (NCME's Outstanding Dissertation Award), as well as $20,000 Stanford fellowship. Taught/co-taught seven courses:<br>
					<br>
					<strong>1)</strong>Hierarchical Linear Models (PhD seminar)<br>
